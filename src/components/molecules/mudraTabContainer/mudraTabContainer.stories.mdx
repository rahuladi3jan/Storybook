# Tabs

Tabs make it easy to explore and switch between different views.
Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

#### The content of Tabs is mounted by default even if that tab is not focused. This default behavior supports server-side rendering and SEO.

## Usage

### 1. Basic Horizontal Tabs

At a time only selected tab content will be there. Tab Header will be Horizontal.

# Tabs

Tabs make it easy to explore and switch between different views.
Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

#### The content of Tabs is mounted by default even if that tab is not focused. This default behavior supports server-side rendering and SEO.

## Usage

### 1. Basic Horizontal Tabs

At a time only selected tab content will be there. Tab Header will be Horizontal.

export const BasicHorizontalTabs = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ margin: "16px" }}>

                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and

                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45
                BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one
                of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                from sections and of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes
                of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
                treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, comes from a line in

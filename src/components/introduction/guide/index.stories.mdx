      <h5>What is storybook ?</h5>
      <p>
        - Storybook is a JavaScript tool that allows developers to create
        organized UI systems making both the building process and documentation
        more efficient and easier to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        - It provides an organized and focused environment to build new
        components and work on existing ones, and test components in isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        - It runs outside of the app, too, so project dependencies won't affect
        the behaviour of components.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Refer to installation part to know how to get install and use these
        components built in storybook.
